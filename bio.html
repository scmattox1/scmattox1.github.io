				<p>Hello! My name is Sarah. Welcome to my portfolio site! I'm currently working as a front end web designer in South Bend, Indiana, but I am open to any work in the Western/Center part of Michigan and the Northwest part of Indiana. Basically, I'm willing to communte up to an hour from Paw Paw, MI.</p>
				<h3>The Work Part of Me</h3>
				<p>Through my job experiences, I've learned that I enjoy the "let's come up with something new" type of projects over just keeping branding consistent. Don't get me wrong - consistency is extremely important and needed. However, my true talents really shine when given a challenge and the freedom to play aroud.</p>
				<p>Currently I've just finished up a HUGE multi-site redesign where I was able to implement new concepts and elements that my company had not considered before. The sites were very outdated and I made them responsive using flexbox, and also incorporated file saving techniques such as using SVGs and font icons when possible. What I'm researching and practicing right now is how to create a useful living CI Guideline for all these sites for consistency with other designers and updates. It's been an exciting adventure and I love that I was able to carry out the idea from start to finish. <i>Well</i> almost to finish - There's still so much to be done!</p>

				<h3>The Play Part of Me</h3>
				<p>What I do for work used to be what I did for fun. How awesome is that?! However, now that I work in Photoshop and Illustrator for 40+ hours a week, I had to find new things to do for fun. A fun-er fun, I guess. [Sidenote: this is why I don't create copy content for my company's site.]</p>
				<p><emp-text>When I can...</emp-text>I love to travel and to go wheeling! I have to put these two together because it's rare for me to go across the country and not stop in Colorado or Moab to do some wheeling. This is one of the reasons I'm so happy that I moved to Michigan!</p>
				<p><emp-text>Most weekends...</emp-text>I keep myself busy with house projects or craft projects. Landscaping, quilting, vegetable garden, water coloring, shelves in the bathroom, journaling, barn door closet doors... If I had a tv show, I could be the next Joanna Gaines!</p>
				<p><emp-text>Every night...</emp-text>I like to cook. I've perfected my Italian style thin crust pizza and I've got the <i>how do I make chicken exciting?</i> question answered. I commute an hour to work every day and I still insist on making good - and perhaps considered complicated to some - meals. Things like Sriracha Teriaki Meatballs or true General Tso (which has 20+ ingredients) are pretty common for me to make.</p>
				<p><emp-text>Every second of my day...</emp-text>I have Farrah and Tucker. I adopted a couple of rescue pits by the name of Farrah and Tucker and they are my life. I talk to them, make clothes for them, plan out weekend trips with them...it's actually a little embarrassing. My bf calls them our fur-babies and while I hate the term, it's true.</p>
