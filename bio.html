				    <p>Hello! My name is Sarah. Welcome to my portfolio site! I am currently working as a Web Designer in South Bend, Indiana. I am willing to work anywhere in the West Michigan or Michiana area.</p>
				    <h3>My Work...</h3>
				    <p>I greatly enjoy new creative and challenging projects. I have been told many times that I treat the sites I work on 'like they are my babies.' Not only do I care about what I am working on, but I want to be involve in its creation, its development, and what happens to it after I am done.</p>
                    <img class="img-right" alt="Image: Handmade Quilt" src="/assets/images/quilt.jpg">
				    <p>In the past few years, I have created and implemented site redeisgns and responsive layouts. While working on these redesigns, I incorporated the usage of SVGs, font icons, and fluid CSS layouts using primarily flebox. I also worked on maintaing multi-brand consistency and creating living style guidelines for other designers to reference.</p>
                    <p>I have a moderate understanding of SCSS, JQuery, Java, and other back-end development languages. When applicable and time-allowed, I work on these skills within my work.</p>
                    <p>My career has been mostly in computer art, web design, and front-end development. I have a school background in computer animation which was focused primarily on character rigging, modeling, and animation. I also have studied art in various medias.</p>
				    <h3>...And All the Rest</h3>
				    <p>Growing up, I used to create computer graphics and websites for fun, but now that I do that for a living, I have expanded my interests.</p>

				    <p><emp-text>When I can...</emp-text>I travel and off road. I'll take day trips up to Silverlake to race in the sand or a week out to Colorado to climb the mountains.</p>
				    <p><emp-text>Most weekends...</emp-text>I like to work on house projects and crafts. From landscaping to quilting and building shelves to journaling, I like to stay busy.</p>
				    <p><emp-text>Every night...</emp-text>I love to cook and, occasionally, bake. I have perfected my Italian thin crust pizza and I have the <i>how do I make chicken exciting?</i> question answered. When I have the whole day, I will stew tomatoes for my own marinara sauce or make a tray of assorted cookies.</p>
                    <p><emp-text>All the time...</emp-text>I have Farrah and Tucker. I adopted a couple of rescue pits and they are my life.</p>
