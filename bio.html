				    <p>Hello! My name is Sarah. Welcome to my portfolio site! I am currently working as a Digital Marketing Coordinator remotely for a credit union based in St. Joseph, Michigan. Physically on campus, I am willing to work anywhere in the West Michigan or Michiana area. Remotely, I am willing to work for a company located anywhere! At this time, I will not consider relocating (thanks housing market).</p>
				    <h3>My Work...</h3>
				    <p>I greatly enjoy new creative and challenging projects. I have been told that I treat my projects 'like they are my babies.' I'm invested in my projects from beginning to beyond completion; this includes creation, development, and data after going live. My perception is that a project can be deemed 'job well done' only after the feedback is provided. Furthermore, with the rate of advancing technology, a project should never truly disappear. There's always room for improvement and advancement.</p>
                    <img class="img-right" alt="Image: Homemade Cookies" src="/assets/images/cookies.jpg">
				    <p>In a previous position, I have created and implemented site redesigns and responsive layouts built from scratch. In these redesigns, I've incorporated the usage of SVGs, font icons, fluid CSS layouts using primarily flexbox, semantic HTML, and living style guidelines.</p>
                    <p>These redesigns and site projects were done with a large team. The team often consisted of a project manager, analysis, UX, developer, testers, and myself. My role as the front-end designer would be to design the aesthetic appearance and build the HTML and CSS for the design. Based on the system that the company used, my position was considered the lead for projects. I would be the middle ground. The analysis and UX would work with me to determine the best design and layout, and the developer and testers would go to me for clarity on the design.</p>
                    <p>In my current position, I am part of a very small team with a self-management system. Now I am the front-end designer, the UX, partial analytics, partial development, tester, and PM all at once! I've additionally gained the experience of working with third-party vendors rather than in-house solutions. Currently, I am in the unique situation of being unable to work on our current website while also being a part of a team researching the possibility of obtaining a new CRM and CMS. During this strange lull of duties, I'm working on building a design system, wireframes and templates for a redesign, and internal research to find my company's pain points. This is so that when the time comes for a new website, we will have all the assets and research available.</p>
					<p>These two companies have provided me with vastly different environments and skillsets. One has a strong digital foundation and internal structure that gave me time to learn coding, design, and wire framework correctly. In that environment, I would need to be able to defend my solution in a room of peers. The other has less structure but a strong desire to be better which has given me the opportunity to be a leader, propose new ideas, and start new projects. In this environment, I oftentimes need to explain my solution to a room of untechnical leaders along with cost considerations for the solution.</p>
					<p>My skill set is strongly in design, HTML, CSS, and general UX. I have a moderate understanding of SCSS, JQuery, Java, and other development languages. When applicable and time-allowed, I work on these skills within my everyday projects.</p>

				    <p>Growing up, I used to create computer graphics and websites for fun, but now that I do that for a living, I have expanded my interests.</p>
				    <p><emp-text>When I can...</emp-text> I travel and off-road. I'll take day trips up to Silverlake to race in the sand or a week out to Colorado to climb the mountains.</p>
				    <p><emp-text>Most weekends...</emp-text>I like to work on house projects and crafts. From landscaping to quilting and building shelves to journaling, I like to stay busy.</p>
				    <p><emp-text>Every night...</emp-text> I love to cook and bake. I have a small-town side business selling cookies for the holidays. During the summer, I grow herbs, peppers, onions, and tomatoes. I often stew tomatoes for my own marinara sauce and make sourdough bread (before it became popular!).</p>
                    <p><emp-text>All the time...</emp-text> I have Farrah and Tucker. I adopted a couple of rescue pits and they are my life.</p>
